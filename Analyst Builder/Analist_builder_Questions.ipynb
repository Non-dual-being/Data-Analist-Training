    "### Uitleg over het gebruik van `map()` in pandas voor hiërarchische gegevensverwerking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Belangrijkste concepten:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Maskeren van de juiste rijen**:\n",
    "   - Selecteer eerst de werknemers die nog geen hiërarchieniveau (`level`) hebben.\n",
    "   - Vervolgens controleer je of hun `supervisor_id` overeenkomt met de `employee_id` van een supervisor die al een niveau heeft (dus waarvan het `level` niet `NaN` is).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gebruik van `map()` voor gegevensverrijking**:\n",
    "   - Nadat je de juiste werknemers hebt gefilterd, gebruik je de `supervisor_id` om het `level` van de supervisor op te halen.\n",
    "   - Je zet de `employee_id` als index en beschouwt dit als een soort woordenboek waarin je het niveau van de supervisor kunt opzoeken.\n",
    "   - De `map()`-functie koppelt de `supervisor_id` van de werknemer aan het `level` van hun supervisor, alsof je in een woordenboek zoekt op basis van de supervisor's `employee_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hiërarchieniveau toekennen**:\n",
    "   - Het `level` van de werknemer wordt berekend door het niveau van de supervisor te nemen en daar 1 bij op te tellen.\n",
    "   - Dit komt omdat elke werknemer altijd één niveau lager staat dan zijn of haar supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handige inzichten:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Het gebruik van de `map()`-functie in pandas biedt een slimme manier om hiërarchische relaties dynamisch te verwerken zonder dat je complexe iteraties of SQL-achtige joins nodig hebt.\n",
    "- Het is mogelijk om op een efficiënte manier gegevens te transformeren door de index als een soort 'lookup table' te gebruiken.\n"
